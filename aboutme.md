### My story

Tony Tran is a Research/Teaching assistant at the University of Houston. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering Technology and currently pursuing his Master's degree in Engineering Data Science and AI, thesis track under [Dr. Bin Hu](https://binhu85.github.io/). His research focuses on TinyML and hardware-aware neural architecture search for AI model deployment on resource-constrained devices through model compression techniques (pruning, quantization). He is especially interested in efficient edge vision (e.g., classification, detection, segmentation), model inference optimization, and robust neural networks.
